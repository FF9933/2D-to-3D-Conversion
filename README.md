<h1>3D-Human-Pose-Estimation (README)</h1>


<h3>The goal</h3>

The mission behind this project, is to create a fast, reliable and simple 3D Pose Estimation using *one* camera.
Doing so requires an accurate 2D-to-3D Conversion, only a few solutions exist out there, when trying those out, top notch solutions were very inaccurate.
Mediapipe from Google is one of the more advanced models, which is not a guarantee for being good. <br>
Therefor this repo was created.
