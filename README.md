<h1>3D-Human-Pose-Estimation (README)</h1>


<h3>The goal</h3>


The mission behind this project, is to create a fast, reliable and simple 3D Pose Estimation using __one__ camera.
Doing so requires an accurate 2D-to-3D Conversion, only a few solutions exist out there, yet all seem to be inaccurate.
Mediapipe from Google is one of the more advanced models, yet is not accurate enough. <br>
Therefor this repo was created.
